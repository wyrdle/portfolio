        <h3>WIP Nights</h3>
        <p>WIP Night is an event where Sydney-based game developers are invited to talk about their work-in-progress projects, sharing whatever challenges they've faced and how they've overcome them to fellow developers. These talks range from technical knowledge, to more personal hurdles and journeys. As such, WIP nights become a space for local developers to deepen their connections and learn from each other. For more information about this event, check out <a href="https://noblesteedgames.com/culture/wip-night/">its website.</a></p>
